    You should aim to accommodate all dietary requirements, and be explicit about doing so.
---

You can anticipate some common dietary requirements in advance. Here’s a set that probably covers 90%+ of attendees:

*   Vegetarian
*   Vegan
*   Dairy-free
*   Gluten-free
*   Nut-free
*   [Halal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halal)
*   [Kosher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher)

If you know you’ll be providing food for these requirements, say so upfront. Ask for dietary requirements when people buy their ticket, so you you can make the right amount, or know if you’ve forgotten something.

Make sure food is clearly labelled, both by category and ingredients.

For allergies like nut- and gluten-free, it’s helpful to have details about the kitchen, if possible. For example, *“This was prepared in a nut-free kitchen”* vs *“This wasn’t prepared in a nut-free kitchen, but separate utensils and surfaces were used”*. For some people, that difference matters.

You may need to remind non-vegetarians not to eat all the vegetarian food, so the vegetarians don’t go hungry! Separate queues for different types of food, or taking people’s food orders in advance, can both help with this.

Alternatively, a couple of conferences (You Got This, Open Source Bridge) have only provided vegan/vegetarian food, so there's no risk of it running out!
