    If you know the area, you probably know where's a good place to stay – and conversely, where you really <em>don't</em> want to stay.

If you run a conference in the same place for several years, you’ll get an idea of where the good accommodation is – which hostels are friendly, which hotels are in a quiet area, and so on.
If someone's out of town, they won't know any of that, so tell them.
They’ll get a better night’s sleep, and enjoy your event all the more!

You may be able to negotiate preferential rates at local hotels/hostels for your attendees.

For the last two years at PyCon UK, we had a block booking at a local hostel ([Mrs. Potts](http://www.mrspottsbackpackers.co.uk/)). Lots of people had a good stay there, we used it for financial assistance recipients, and we'll probably recommend it again next year.
It also helped us solve a couple of sudden problems when somebody arrived with nowhere to stay, and we were able to give them a bed in Mrs. Potts.
