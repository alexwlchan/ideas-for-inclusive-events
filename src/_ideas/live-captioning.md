    Hiring a stenographer means you can provide real-time captioning of talks, which makes them much easier to follow for people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing.

Hire a stenographer to provide real-time captioning on talks, which can be displayed on screens alongside the speaker.
Primarily this helps people who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, or non-native speakers.
It can also help if somebody misses a word, the speaker has a strong accent, or their focus drifts -- the transcript gives a way to catch up.

To support the captioners, ask speakers for specialist/technical terms in advance.
They can be programmed into the stenographer’s special keyboards, so you get more accurate transcriptions.

Make sure the screen(s) showing the captions are easily visible -- ideally raised enough that they're visible from more than just the front row, and on both sides of the stage if you have room.

Captioning can happen in-person (when the captioner travels to the event), or it's possible to do it remotely over Skype.

I first saw this [at PyCon UK 2016](https://alexwlchan.net/2016/09/speech-to-text/), but I’ve since seen it at lots of other conferences.
