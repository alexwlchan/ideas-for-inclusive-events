    The best preparation in the world is wasted if the speaker can't get to the stage.

Presenting in an unfamilar environment can present challenges.
Make sure your speakers can physically get to the stage, and present their talk when they get there.

Things you might think about:

*   If you have a raised stage, you should provide a ramp or other step-free access from the ground to the stage.
    This is most visibly important for wheelchair users, but other people may have hidden disabilities that make steps hard to navigate.

*   Being on a stage with bright lights can be intimidating.
    For some people it causes migraines, for others the heat is disconcerting.
    Be ready to reduce the lights for somebody, and provide water for them to drink onstage.

    At Monki Gras 2019, one of the speakers talked about getting migraines from bright lights, and the A/V team instantly dimmed them.

*   Normally people stand to give a talk, but that's not a guarantee.

    For some people, standing for long periods is a source of pain, and they'd rather sit to give the presentation.
    Think about how you might accommodate somebody who doesn't want to stand.
    Would your A/V setup still work if they're not standing at the lecturn?

*   If they aren't plugging in their own laptop, check the presenter can use your equipment.

    At Monki Gras 2019, Lorna Mitchell talked about being [a keyboard-only user](https://noti.st/lornajane/xkdbqh/tales-of-a-keyboard-only-user).
    She never uses a pointing device, so having to use a strange computer is a source of problems and frustration.
    When something like that happens, you need to allow time for people to try using your equipment.
