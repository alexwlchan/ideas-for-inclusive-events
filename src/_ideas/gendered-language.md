    Phrases like "ladies and gentlemen" and "boys and girls" are alienating to trans and non-binary attendees.

Both of those are terms we often reach for in a formal setting, and forget that they're excluding non-binary people who identify as neither male nor female.
Some possible alternatives (adjust for formality):

*   "everyone"
*   "honoured guests"
*   "distinguished attendees"
*   "attractive and lovely people" (yes, I have heard this one!)

Gendered language can also come up when you're identifying an audience member (for example, somebody who's asking a question).
I find clothing a good way to identify people -- so rather than saying "the woman in the second row", I might say "the person in the green scarf".
Appearance isn't a good way to determine gender.
And as a bonus, clothing is almost always more specific than a gender, or a vague gesture and "you there".
