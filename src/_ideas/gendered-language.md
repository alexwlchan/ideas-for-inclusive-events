    Phrases like "ladies and gentlemen" and "boys and girls" are alienating to trans and non-binary attendees.
---

Both of those are terms we often reach for in a formal setting, and forget that they're excluding non-binary people who identify as neither male nor female.
Some possible alternatives (adjust for formality):

*   "everyone"
*   "honoured guests"
*   "distinguished attendees"
*   "attractive and lovely people" (yes, I have heard this one!)
