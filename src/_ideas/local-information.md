    If somebody's travelling to a strange city for your event, help them get around when the conference finishes for the day.
---

There's a good chance at least one of your organisers knows the local area, and your attendees don't.
So tell them what's available â€“ what's good and useful near the venue?
That could include:

*   Shops
*   Places to eat and drink
*   Local attractions
*   Where to get emergency medication or toiletries

Help them not be stranded and lost in a strange city when the conference finishes for the day.
