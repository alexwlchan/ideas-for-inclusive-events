    Coming to a conference for the first time can be intimidating, so make sure you're giving a warm and useful welcome to your first timers.

For several years, Write The Docs conferences have run a “Welcome Wagon” – there’s a dedicated session for meeting other first-time attendees, tours of the venue, and a bunch of information about how the conference works. The Welcome Wagon for [the 2018 Prague conference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/welcome-wagon/) has lots of advice and suggestions about how to get the most from the conference.

Although a lot of that page is Prague or Write The Docs-specific, the questions apply to any conference – you could write answers for your event.
