    Don't discount the generosity of your attendees: give them an easy way to contribute to the financial assistance pool.
---

Usually financial assistance comes corporate sponsorship, but if you have generous attendees, they may contribute something as well.

For example, AlterConf and You Got This both had a way to buy extra tickets.
You could buy a single ticket, claim one of the free tickets, or pay for extra tickets which went into the free ticket pool.

Here’s a screenshot from the AlterConf London ticketing page:

There are seven tiers (from bottom to top):

*   Scholarship, free
*   Basic, £25
*   Friend (helps 1 person), £50
*   Supporter (helps 2 people), £75
*   Advocate (helps 3 people), £100
*   Patron (helps 4 people), £125
*   Super Friend (helps 5+ people), which is a free text box that starts at £150

Similarly, at PyCon UK, we sell conference swag (t-shirts, hoodies, etc) through an online shop.
The proceeds go directly to the financial assistance budget.
