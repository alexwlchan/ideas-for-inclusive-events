    Don't discount the generosity of your attendees: give them an easy way to contribute to the financial assistance pool.

Most financial assistance will come from corporate sponsorship, but if you have generous attendees, they may contribute something as well.

For example, AlterConf and You Got This both had a way to buy extra tickets.
You could buy a single ticket, claim one of the free tickets, or pay for extra tickets which went into the free ticket pool.

Here’s a screenshot from the AlterConf London ticketing page:

    There are seven tiers: Scholarship (free), Basic (£25), Friend, Supporter, Advocate, Patron and Super Friend.
    The tiers above Basic allow you to buy extra tickets, and the Super Friend tier is a freeform box.

Similarly, at PyCon UK, we sell conference swag (t-shirts, hoodies, etc) through an online shop.
The proceeds go directly to the financial assistance budget.
