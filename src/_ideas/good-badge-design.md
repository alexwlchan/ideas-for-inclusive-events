    We use name badges to identify people.
    So make them easy to read!

In practice, that means printing the name in a large, clear font.
Every conference I've been to has done plain black on white in a sans serif font, and that works well.

Nobody wants to waste time reading the badge -- keep it short, simple, easy to glance at.

If you're using badges with a lanyard (and not a badge holder), print on both sides of the badge so it remains readable if it flips over.
