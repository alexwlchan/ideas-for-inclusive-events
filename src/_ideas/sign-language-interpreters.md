    A sign language interpreter can help an attendee who's hard-of-hearing, both to understand talks and when chatting in the corridor.
---

This is similar to [real-time captioning]({{ site.url }}/ideas/live-captioning/) -- it makes the event more accessible to people who are hard-of-hearing.

Note that these are distinct things: some people can understand sign language but have more difficulty reading; for others the opposite is true.

It's less useful to a general audience, because most people aren't fluent in sign language.
But if the interpreter stays with a particular person, that allows them to participate in conversations outside the main sessions.

Remember that sign languages vary around the world -- for example, British and German Sign Language are as different as English and German.
And even the English sign languages differ -- British Sign Language and American Sign Language are two separate languages, and mutually incomprehensible.
It's not like British and American English.
If you're running an event [in multiple languages]({{ site.url }}/ideas/multilingual-conferences/), you may want an interpreter for each language.

Most events I've seen only offer sign language interpreters upon request, but provide live captioning as standard.
