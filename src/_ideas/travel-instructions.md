    Provide instructions for how to get to the venue, because it's probably less obvious than you think.
---

For anything but the smallest events, you'll have attendees who aren't local.
They may not be familiar with local transport or what route they should be taking.

Provide instructions about how to get to the venue, especially if it's non-obvious.
For example:

*   Does Google Maps take you to the wrong street?
*   Which entrance should I use?
*   How do I get from the nearest station to the venue?
    If the station has multiple exits, which one should I use?

You should also try to provide step-free routes to the venue, which are useful for wheelchair users or people with mobility problems.
Your attendees donâ€™t magically appear at your front door.

Some transport companies provide discounts if people are going to events or conferences.
For example, GWR have [special conference rates](https://www.gwr.com/plan-journey/tickets-railcards-and-season-tickets/business-travel/conferences-and-events), and LNER have [discounts for conventions in Harrogate](https://www.lner.co.uk/special-offers/deals/25-off-harrogate-convention-centre/).
See if there are any special deals that apply to you, and then tell people about them before they book their travel.
