  >-
    Help your attendees find their way round an unfamiliar venue by providing dedicated, branded signage, with large and clear text.
---

The branding makes it clear that the signs are for your event, and not the standard venue signage, or part of another event.
The signs should include:

*   Arrows highlighting the way around the venue
*   A sign on each room you're using
*   Internal maps with dots to show "you are here"

Good signage will save your organisers from answering the same question repeatedly, and helps attendees who canâ€™t find a organiser, or who might feel awkward asking.

We had a lot of fun [making the signs](https://alexwlchan.net/2018/09/lessons-in-signage/) for PyCon UK 2018, and I want to do it again in 2019.
