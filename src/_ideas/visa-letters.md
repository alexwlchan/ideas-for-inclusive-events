    An invitation letter can help somebody with their visa application.
---

If you have international attendees, you may have somebody who needs a visa to come to the conference.

Writing a letter to say somebody is attending or speaking at your conference is a useful service, and may help their visa application.
(Sadly, it's [not guaranteed](https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/10082018-egyptian-curators-denied-visas).)
Be upfront that this is something you can offer, and tell people how to ask for an invitation letter.

Reply to requests promptly -- the wheels of bureaucracy move slowly, and delays may adversely affect somebody's visa application.

I did the visa invitation letters for PyCon UK 2018 â€“ email me if you'd like our letter template.
