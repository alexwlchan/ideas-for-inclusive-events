title: Provide bathroom baskets of basic toiletries

    Finding basic toiletries (sanitary, dental, haircare products) in a strange city or country can be difficult.
    Providing them directly in your bathrooms relieves a bit of that stress.

I first heard of this idea from [Write The Docs](https://twitter.com/yo_bj/status/993175805646835712), who were inspired by DjangoCon Europe.
Here's an excerpt from [DjangoCon’s sponsor brochure](https://2018.djangocon.eu/assets/sponsor-brochure.pdf):

> **Bathroom basket sponsor** <br>
> We’ll provide baskets with basic medical, sanitary and similar supplies for free at the conference bathrooms.

This ensures that if somebody is caught out in the middle of the day, they don’t need to go far for help – or miss much of the conference.

Examples of what you might include: sanitary products, spray-on deodorant, sunscreen, toothbrushes, dry shampoo.

Put the same products in all your bathrooms, including sanitary products -- periods aren't something that exclusively affect able-bodied women.
Put them in the men's and accessible bathrooms as well.

Providing painkillers and medication would be nice as well, but check local laws and rules first.
You probably shouldn't leave them unattended in the bathrooms (where children can get them).
You might be able to keep some on the registration desk, or if not, point people [to local pharmacies]({{ site.url }}/ideas/local-information).

As well as sanitary products, I saw haircare and dental products at You Got This 2018.
Apparently this is a feature of [the Monzo offices](https://twitter.com/aishpant/status/1086637102908035077) where the event was hosted.
