    Destigmatise the feeding of young children in public spaces, and provide a space to do it privately if people prefer.
---

It's 2019.
Feeding young children (whether breastfeeding or formula feeding) should be destigmatised, and acceptable in all conference spaces -- including in talks and at mealtimes.

Some people will prefer to breastfeed in private, so you should have a clean, quiet, private room for them.
At minimum, the room needs a table and a chair.
Electricity and a fridge are nice to have as well.
(This should be different to [the quiet room]({{ site.url }}/ideas/quiet-room/).)
