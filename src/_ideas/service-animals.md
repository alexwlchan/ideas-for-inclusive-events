    If the venue permits, allow service animals throughout, and make sure the animals are looked after.

Different venues will have different rules about whether they allow service animals, and which animals they allow.
(This may also be affected by local laws.)

Ideally you want to allow service animals throughout the conference.

Remember [basic etiquette]({{ site.url }}/ideas/dont-interfere/): service animals are working, so don't pet or distract them without checking with the owner.
You might stop them from doing something important!

Just as you provide food and drink for the human attendees, you can provide them for service animals as well.
Here's an idea I got from [GitHub Universe 2018](https://blog.github.com/2018-08-02-github-universe-scholarship-program/):

> Fresh water, treats, and an onsite relief area for service or therapy dogs
