    Simply saying a venue is "wheelchair accessible" is rarely enough, because wheelchairs come in different shapes and sizes. More detail is better.
---

Those details might include:

*   Is there step-free access within the venue?
    Is it ramps or lifts?
    How big are the lifts?

*   How wide are the doorways?
    If the main area is some way inside a building, what’s the narrowest doorway you need to get there?

*   Are there wheelchair spaces inside the auditorium?
    How wide are the aisles between the seats?

*   How easy is it for a wheelchair user to get to the venue?
    It's no good having an accessible venue that's surrounded by raised kerbs and without any step-free public transport.

*   Are there heavy doors inside the building that a wheelchair user might struggle to open?
    Is there a route with automatic doors?

*   What's the floor surface like?
    Heavy carpet, tiles, wood -- if you're walking they're mostly the same, but they can be very different in a wheelchair.

This might make the difference between whether somebody can physically attend your event, or they can't.
If it's the latter, it's much better to find out before they turn up.
