    Simply saying a venue is "wheelchair accessible" is rarely enough, because wheelchairs come in different shapes and sizes. More detail is better.
---

Those details might include:

*   Is there step-free access within the venue?
    Is it ramps or lifts?
    How big are the lifts?

*   How wide are the doorways?
    If the main venue is some way inside a building, what’s the narrowest doorway you need to get to the main conference area?

*   Are there wheelchair spaces inside the auditorium?
    How wide are the aisles between the seats?

*   How easy is it for a wheelchair user to get to the venue?
    It's no good having an accessible venue that's surrounded by raised kerbs and without any step-free public transport.
