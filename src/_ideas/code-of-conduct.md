    A code of conduct explains what sort of behaviour is acceptable at your event, how violations will be dealt with, and how to report a problem.
    It shows potential attendees that they should feel safe at your event.

It's important to run an event where everybody is shown respect, courtesy, and kindness, and a code of conduct (CoC) is a reminder for everybody to do that.

A good code of conduct will explain:

*   What sort of behaviour is acceptable at the event
*   What to do if somebody sees bad behaviour (i.e., how to report it to the organisers)
*   How the organisers will handle a report

Advertise the CoC prominently -- on your website, when buying tickets, in your introductory remarks at the start of the day.
Make sure people know about it.

A code of conduct is only as good as its enforcement -- so you have to follow through with it.
Have a documented procedure for dealing with bad behaviour, and stick to it.

Don’t be shy about calling out problems if they occur.
At PyCon UK 2016, if there was a CoC violation, we did three things:

-   We tweeted about it from the conference Twitter account
-   The problem was mentioned in the opening remarks the following day, with an explanation of what happened and how it was resolved
-   After the conference, there was a [code of conduct report](https://2016.pyconuk.org/news/20160919-coc/) that summarised the two issues

This helps people see that you’re enforcing the CoC (and hopefully makes them feel more comfortable making a report, if they need to).
It also serves as a counterpoint to people who say "this sort of behaviour doesn’t happen in our community" -- unfortunately, it almost certainly does.

    It has lots of detail about what makes a good CoC, and answers common questions and objections.

*   A lot of tech conferences have a Code of Conduct.
    You can Google around to find some examples.
