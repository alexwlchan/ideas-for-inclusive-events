    Names are complicated, and you can’t be sure what name somebody wants to put on their badge – so ask!
---

When you're running an event, there are several reasons you might need somebody's name:

*   To print on their badge
*   Legal ID to get into the venue
*   If you're booking flights or accommodation for them

When you ask for somebody's name, you should be very clear about how it will be used, and where it will appear.
Some examples:

> This is the name that will appear on your conference badge: &lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;
>
> You need legal ID to get into the venue. The name on your legal ID will will *not* appear on your conference badge: &lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;
>
> We need the name on your passport to book your flights. The name on your passport will not be on your badge: &lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;&lowbar;

People put all sorts of names on their badges -- wallet names, nicknames, their online handle -- whatever they think will help people recognise them.
Don't make assumptions about what should be printed there, or what they'll prefer.

Don't just use the name from somebody's legal ID -- this causes problems for trans and non-binary people, or anybody using a different name professionally to their legal name.
For example, married women who work under their maiden name.

The name field should be a single, free text field – no “first name, last name”, or other [assumptions about the structure of names](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/).
