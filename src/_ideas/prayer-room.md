    Offer a dedicated room for prayer, and highlight local places of worship.

Most events in the tech industry are secular, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t welcome delegates from different faith backgrounds.

If you have the space, a room dedicated for prayer would be a nice accommodation. Specify what equipment you provide, if any.
(I'm sure I knew a conference offering this, but I've since lost the links.)

If you're hosting a multi-day conference or expect people to be travelling afar, pointers to local places of worship would be useful.
