    Have a space to take a break away from the bustle of the conference.

Networking and socialising is an important part of conferences, but it tires a lot of people out.
Have a clearly-marked, designated space where people can sit quietly, not talk to anybody, and recover some of their energy.
I wrote about [the quiet room at PyCon UK](https://alexwlchan.net/2016/09/silence-is-golden/) in 2016, and sitting in the quiet room is how I’ve got through a number of other conferences.

    The PyCon UK quiet room is usually the Cardiff City Council Chamber, which is a lovely space for sitting quietly. It’s also a good place to work and prepare slides. Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/152472562@N06/37957275512/in/album-72157666242950547/">Mark Hawkins</a>.
