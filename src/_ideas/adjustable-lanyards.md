I met somebody recently who always ties a knot or two in their conference lanyard before wearing it.
They're quite short, and the default lanyard length leaves the badge hanging near their crotch, which is just awkward and unpleasant.
Adding the knots shortens the lanyard, and pulls it up a bit.

I don't know if there's a good, general-purpose solution for this (multiple lengths of lanyard?).
But I'm writing it down because it's another thing you might want to think about.
