    There are simple rules that make slides easier for everyone to read.
---

These rules include:

*   Large font size
*   High-contrast colours
*   Think about common colour-blindnesses when making colour slides
*   No animated GIFs on an infinite loop (which are distracting)
*   Nothing bright and flashing (an epilepsy risk)

If speakers have informative graphics in their slides, they should describe them aloud for visually impaired members of their audience.

If speakers want to include graphic images of harm or something similarly traumatising, consider asking them whether they really need it, and if they do, to provide a content warning.

Posting slides online, or having printed copies, can be useful for people who struggle to read from a projector or screen.
