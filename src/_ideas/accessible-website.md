    If your website isn't accessible or is missing critical info, there are people who can't even get through the front door.

There are lots of good resources about web accessibility, so I won't repeat the details here.
The [W3C accessibility guidelines (WCAG)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) are a good starting point; search around for other advice.

Some key things to consider:

*   Is the font size sufficiently big?
    Does the layout break if I increase it?
*   Is there enough colour contrast?
*   Can you navigate the site without a pointing device?
*   Does the site break if you disable JavaScript?
*   Can I easily see/find links? Useful information?
*   Do you have alt texts for any informative images?

This needs to apply to all aspects of the conference site: the initial information, schedule, ticket buying, call for proposals.

At Monki Gras 2019, [Lorna Mitchell's talk](https://noti.st/lornajane/xkdbqh/tales-of-a-keyboard-only-user) flagged Typeform as completely inaccessible to keyboard-only users.
Her example was a Call for Proposals that was done in Typeform -- and since she can't use the form, she won't submit to that conference.

Here's a basic list of information that should be easy to find:

*   Information about the event: when is it, where is it
*   Information about the venue (see also: [write travel instructions]({{ site.url }}/ideas/travel-instructions/))
*   How to register for the event (sign up or ticketing)
*   How to submit proposals
*   Key dates: deadlines for tickets, proposals
*   The schedule
*   The [code of conduct]({{ site.url }}/ideas/code-of-conduct/)
