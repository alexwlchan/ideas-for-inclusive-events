    Modify your venue to include single-stall, gender-neutral bathrooms, and have a policy that everybody can use whichever bathroom they like.

At tech conferences I’ve been to, there are lots of trans and non-binary people, who are often excluded or marginalised by traditionally gendered toilets.
Modifying your venue to have some gender-neutral bathrooms is a good way to make them feel included.

When AlterConf was still running, it was a staple of the conference tweets to see somebody take a photo of the gender-neutral bathroom signs (this is in Berlin):

If it’s not possible (for example, you’re sharing your conference space), remind your attendees not to challenge somebody else's choice of bathroom.
For example, here's [a sign from one of the Write The Docs conferences](https://twitter.com/carolstran/status/906888286370660352):

> If you’re using this toilet and you think a person’s gender doesn’t match the sign on the door, follow these steps:
>
> Don’t worry about it, they know better than you.

If your venue is large enough, the ideal is a mixture of gender-neutral and gendered bathrooms.
