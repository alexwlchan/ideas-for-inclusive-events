<p class="intro">
  Most of these aren’t original ideas – this is a collection of other people's ideas, either from conferences I've attended myself or followed online.
</p>

I've tried to include credit on the individual ideas.
This page also has a list of *everybody* who gave me an idea or suggestion that went on the list, or at least as many as I can remember.


## Conferences

Many of these ideas are drawn from conferences I've attended, including:

*   [AlterConf](https://www.alterconf.com/)
*   [Monki Gras](https://monkigras.com/)
*   [PyCon UK](https://2018.pyconuk.org/)
