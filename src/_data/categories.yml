      One of the great parts of regular conferences is having a chance to see people you don’t see anywhere else -- for example, I have friends I only see when I'm at PyCon UK.
      But there's a risk a conference can get a clique-y feel -- everybody who's been before knows each other, and you feel left out if you're new and don't know anybody yet.
      If you want your conference to grow, it’s important to make newcomers feel as welcome as the old timers.
