<p class="intro">
  Most of these aren’t original ideas – this is a collection of other people's ideas, either from conferences I've attended myself or followed online.
</p>

I've tried to include credit on the individual ideas.
This page also has a list of *everybody* who gave me an idea or suggestion that went on the list, or at least as many as I can remember.


## Conferences

Many of these ideas are drawn from conferences I've attended, including:

*   [AlterConf](https://www.alterconf.com/)
*   [Monki Gras](https://monkigras.com/)
*   [PyCon UK](https://pyconuk.org/)
*   [You Got This](https://yougotthis.io/)

Particular shoutout for AlterConf, which did a huge amount of work to make a really inclusive event, most of which was done by [Ashe Dryden](https://twitter.com/ashedryden).
It remains the gold standard by which I judge inclusivity at other conferences (including my own).

And some other conferences which I haven't attended, but seen from afar:

*   [Devopsdays London](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-london/welcome/)
*   [DjangoCon Europe](https://djangocon.eu)
*   GitHub Universe
*   [Nine Worlds](https://nineworlds.co.uk/)
*   [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/)
*   [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/)
*   [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/)
*   [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/) (pronounced "bang bang con")

*   Nicolas Steenhout's blog post [How to make your conference accessible -- and why you should care!](https://incl.ca/how-to-make-your-conference-accessible-and-why-you-should-care/) overlaps with some of what I'm saying, and gave me several other new ideas.

*   Several Twitter threads from different AlterConf's, including [by Sebastian Morr](https://twitter.com/blinry/status/863310340557352960) and [Wick's description of the ticketing](https://twitter.com/wickglyph/status/935935750104743936).
