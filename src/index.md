<p class="intro">
  For better or for worse, conferences and meetups are really important for career development.
  Sharing ideas, having conversations, meeting new people -- if you can't attend, you miss out on a lot of these opportunities.
</p>

<p class="intro">
  <strong>It's important to open these events to as wide a range of people as possible, and make them feel welcome when they attend.</strong>
  It addresses a serious source of unfairness, and everyone benefits from having a wider diversity of people and ideas.
</p>

I'm always fascinated by the things organisers do to make events more inclusive and accessible.
That could be live captioning of talks.
Thoughtfully designed name badges.
A diversity scholarship.
The list goes on, and now the best ideas I've seen are all here.

This mini-site started as a [blog post I wrote in August 2018](https://alexwlchan.net/2018/08/inclusive-conferences/), listing all the ideas I'd seen.
I got lots of good feedback and suggestions -- but nowhere to put them!
A blog post is a point-in-time snapshot; I wanted something I could continually update and improve.

If you organise an event, you can take these ideas to make your events more inclusive and accessible.

If you attend, speak at, or sponsor an event, you have power -- you can ask for these accommodations where they don't already exist.
Be picky about where you choose to participate, and walk away from events that donâ€™t meet your standards.

This page has a list of all the ideas, and a brief summary.
Each idea also has an individual page that goes into more detail, and there's [another page](/everything/) that contains all the detail in one, single, searchable page -- just like that original blog post.

All the source code for the site is [on GitHub]({{ site.github_repo }}).
The site was last updated on {{ site.time | date: site.date_format }}.



# Acknowledgements

Most of these aren't original ideas -- this is a collection of other people's ideas, either from conferences I've attended myself or followed online.

I've helped organise [PyCon UK](https://2018.pyconuk.org/) for the last three years, and there's heavy reference to it throughout -- but most of these ideas predate my involvement.

For a list of all the conferences and people who influenced this site, check out the [acknowledgements page](/acknowledgements/).
