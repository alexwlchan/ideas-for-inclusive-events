Whenever I go to meetups or conferences, I'm always fascinated by the things organisers do to make the event more inclusive and accessible.
That could be live captioning of talks.
Thoughtfully designed name badges.
A diversity scholarship.
Or lots of other things.

In August 2018, I wrote [a blog post](https://alexwlchan.net/2018/08/inclusive-conferences/) that listed the best ideas I'd seen across a variety of events.
Lots of people have said nice things about it, and I hope it's been useful -- but my blog isn't the best place for those ideas.
A blog post is a point-in-time snapshot, but best practices for inclusion change over time.
Plus, I keep writing new posts and making it less visible.

Over the last six months, I've seen new ideas, and received lots of feedback on that post.
I've put everything in a mini-site, which I hope is easier to read and update.
This repo contains the code for that mini-site.

## Contributing

I'm theoretically open to contributions, but the current code is probably a bit idiosyncratic and not very clear.
I'm happy to look at pull requests, but if you can't work out how to make the change you want -- that's my fault, not yours.

If you just want to tell me about something, sending me [an email](mailto:alex@alexwlchan.net), [a tweet](https://twitter.com/alexwlchan), or [opening an issue](https://github.com/alexwlchan/ideas-for-inclusive-events/issues/new) is the best way to do it.
